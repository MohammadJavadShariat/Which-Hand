# Which-Hand
Hello!
This app is a Which Hand game.
In this game, the computer chooses a random number from 1 to 3, and if any number comes up, it indicates one of the options, for example, left-handed or both-handed.
Then the program will ask you which hand?
If you enter the correct option, it means that the entered option is the same as the computer option, a sentence with the correct meaning of "you did something wrong" will be shown, and if you enter the wrong option, a sentence will show that you did something wrong.
If you enter an option other than the available options, it will give an error message.
